            <h3>The House of a Dream World</h3>
            <p>Each Green Magic Home is composed of prefabricated, vaulted panels constructed of recycled, laminate materials that anchor into the foundation and each other. Those walls are then reinforced by soil, which buries the plastic walls partially
                underground, thereby protecting the house from inclement weather and UV radiation. This process also insulates the hobbit home and allows for the natural world to grow atop it.</p>
